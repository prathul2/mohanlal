        Mohanlal has been described in the Indian media as one of the most versatile actors and has been lauded for his natural acting style.Mohanlal is also known by his pet name "Lalettan". Reader's Digest India described him in 2004 as "cinema's jack of all trades and master of many". He was also listed 80th in India's Most Trusted Persons, in a survey conducted by Reader's Digest in 2010. Director Ram Gopal Varma has described Mohanlal as "one of the finest actors in the country who can slip into any role easily".</p>

In 2003, on the 25th anniversary of Mohanlal's film career, a week-long celebration and a stage show were held in Thiruvananthapuram, by his fans and friends. The proceeds from the stage show were donated to charity. Malayalam television channels Asianet and Surya TV also held separate stage shows to celebrate the anniversary.<br/><br/>

Mohanlal has often been accused in the media of causing a crisis in Malayalam cinema due to the "superstar" effect.In 2005, 95 percent of box-office gross in Malayalam cinema came from Mohanlal, Mammootty, and Dileep films. He had been criticized for the high remuneration, preference for formulaic content and larger-than-life male-oriented roles that characterized most of his movies during that period.Mohanlal's many fan clubs which are present throughout Kerala help in creating a buzz around new releases and ensure a good opening in movie screens, a crucial factor to the success of films in Kerala.<br/><br/>

In 2007, some social activists protested against Mohanlal for appearing in a whisky commercial, to which he responded that it is unfair to single him out when so many other Indian actors do the same.In 2010, during a public spat between actor Thilakan and the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) regarding a labour issue, social critic Sukumar Azhikode supported Thilakan and criticized leading Malayalam stars, urging them to step aside since they are old, especially mentioning Mohanlal, that he is "a hypocrite who hid his advancing age to act with younger heroines". Mohanlal responded that Azhikode might be having "hallucinations" and is ignoring it as a joke. This led to further personal remarks by Azhikode against Mohanlal.The two later sorted things out. Azhikode watched Mohanlal's Pranayam in the theatre and praised his performance, Mohanlal also visited him on his death bed in 2012<br/><br/>

The forest department filed a case against Mohanlal for keeping an elephant tusk at his home, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The case was first dismissed by a local Court in Perumbavoor and later by the High Court of Kerala in 2012. An individual from Thrissur filed a petition that the officials had gone out of the way to favour Mohanlal. It was alleged in the petition that the actor and former minister K. B. Ganesh Kumar and forest officials were trying to save Mohanlal and overthrow the case related to the discovery of four elephant tusks at the actor's house during an income tax raid. The petitioner went to Kerala HC, but the Court dismissed the case and observed that "there was nothing to show that the State government or its officers had acted in favour of the actor. Besides, the petitioner had not been able to point out any illegality or irregularities in the investigation. "Mohanlal's lawyer senior advocate M. K. Damodaran informed the court that police are investigating the case and the final report has not yet been submitted. When the lawyer of the plaintiff mentioned that the tusks are still kept in his house, the defendant's lawyer explained that a receipt for the tusks has been obtained and is kept with Mohanlal". Dismissing the petition, the court criticized the petitioner for approaching the High Court even without inquiring about the present status of the case. "There is no public interest in the petition, but it is aimed only at publicity", the court had held.
